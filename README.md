# Web-Threat-Analysis
Web threat analysis is the process of systematically identifying, assessing, and mitigating potential cybersecurity threats that target an organization's web infrastructure, applications, and user activities. It involves surveillance and evaluation of known, unknown, and hidden vulnerabilities to prevent exploitation by malicious actors.

## Overview
This project implements web threat analysis using both machine learning and deep learning techniques. It leverages a variety of libraries to preprocess data, build models, and evaluate their performance. The goal is to provide a robust framework for detecting and mitigating web-based threats such as malware, phishing, and other cybersecurity risks.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handles both numerical and categorical data.
- **Machine Learning**: Includes a Random Forest Classifier for threat detection.
- **Deep Learning**: Utilizes a neural network for advanced threat analysis.
- **Data Visualization**: Visualizes data distributions and model performance.
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Provides tools for real-time analysis and response.

## Libraries Used
- Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
- Seaborn: For statistical data visualization.
- NetworkX: For network analysis (if applicable).
